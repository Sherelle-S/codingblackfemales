PERAMETERS

The perameters for the code are:

RESULTS

I am expecting the following results:
the initial loop runs once,
it sees the condition that if the order count is greater than 20, to take no action.
as the order count is currently 0 it misses this condition, 
NEXT conditon - if active orders is greater than 0 if the option for active orders is present cancel the order, as there is no current order this step is skipped on this loop *Check with tobin if we need to acknowledge this*
I do belive this is where i code in my own cancellation algo.
else take no action, and close loop.
Original loop as the order count is greater it goes to the next conditional of the original loop,
bid level goes up by 1, one share is purchased.

it exit the loop,

the loop runs again, again total orders os less than 20, it goes to the next case 
as this time the active order conditional is met, order is 1. which is greater than 0, we cancel the order.
